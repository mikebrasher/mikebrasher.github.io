This is a demonstration of using Voronoi diagrams and the Fast Marching method to perform path planning for a robot navigating an example maze.

 

Try clicking or anywhere in the maze to set a destination, and the black robot should follow along a path to it. The background is a visualization of the output from the Fast Marching method, earlier arrival times are purple, and later arrival times are yellow.  This should also work on pads, though small mobile screens may not show the whole maze.
